## General info
This is a school project which aim was to create an innovative chatbot to help people to grow a better business. We had to to it in pairs.
<br>We chose to focus on e-commerce businesses. Lil Bot the chatbot allows the user to submit information about the item that he wants to buy. Then, Lil Bot gives back the perfect article corresponding to the criteria. By this mean, people tend to buy more articles and faster, which increase the sales of the e-shop.
<br><br>We had 42 days to implement the project.
<br><br>Here, you can find the source code of a demonstration use of Lil Bot in a clothes e-shop, but the algorithm can be adapted to any kind of shop.
