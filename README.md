General info

This is a school project which aim was to create the mythical Pokedex from the video game Pokemon, listing all Pokemons' caracteristics like their types, evolutions...

I had 37 days to implement the project, and at the same time I had to make two Pre-projects named Postit and Twp which helped me understand the functionning of Laravel's API.
